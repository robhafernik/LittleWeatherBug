From the main.js file in this project:

/**
 * This project implements a "LittleWeatherBug", a small, enclosed display
 * that can be mounted on the wall to show the current temperature,
 * weather conditions, and forecast hi/lo, alternating with the current 
 * time and date.  It is written in Javascript, to run in node.js, and
 * this file set contains the Intel Edison XDK IoT Edition development 
 * environment support files.
 * 
 * This uses the Intel Edison Board: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13276
 * It also uses a white on black serial LCD: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9395
 * 
 * This code is based on an example from the SparkFun Inventor's Kit for the
 * Intel Edison board.  The original code is here:
 * https://github.com/sparkfun/Inventors_Kit_For_Edison_Experiments
 * 
 * SparkFun is a GREAT source for hobby electronics: http://sparkfun.com
 *
 * Rather than Yahoo Weather, this code uses weather data from 
 * OpenWeatherMap: http://openweathermap.org

 * Released into the public domain, do with it as you will.  It is not,
 * however, warranted to be correct in any way.
